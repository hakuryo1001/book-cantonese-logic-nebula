% 當我哋被迫甚至有激勵去講普通話嗰陣，我哋會發現我哋嘅尊嚴受到侵犯。點解聰明嘅香港人一定會覺得同樣嘅論點用喺英文上面好搞笑？如果香港人嘅身體語言根本係廣東話嘅股票，噉講英文，畀人激勵講英文，被迫講英文，又點會係對我哋尊嚴同人格嘅侮辱呢？有好多可能嘅答案。你可以搞出一個歷史學，證明真正嘅英國殖民者係真正嘅香港人 - 佢哋係創始人，而我哋呢班中國難民血統嘅人，同阿拉伯人去埃及係同一班外星人。你可以從實用性嘅角度去論證 - 英國理性、普通法、科技、基督教 - 啟蒙文明等等 - 同埋一個理性嘅香港人為咗自己嘅利益而唔會覺得呢個係冇尊嚴嘅 - 用盧梭用嚟論證嘅同一種論證性嘅诡辩，即係由一個受一般意志指揮嘅議會指示執行一個公民，唔可以係違反個人意志。你可以辯稱呢種羞辱係一種錯覺 —— 而且只係一種階級嘅表現。你甚至可以辯稱，個 honkie 係喺仁慈嘅帝國權力下受到咁神奇嘅訓練同條件，令到呢種冒犯感已經從佢身上培養出嚟。但如果你係總理 - 你會點樣辯護呢？即係講英文唔單止唔係侮辱我哋作為香港人嘅尊嚴 - 而係完全相容、合理，甚至係令人認同？點樣？

% 哈！我哋 事必要 望吓 啲 猶太人 係 點做 先得！    。󱪙 佢  偷師，學吓 人地 係 點樣 過世同 繁殖，保護 兼 保佑 自己。毫無疑問 唔使問阿貴，希伯來文 ，係 猶太人 󱝚 語言，但係 直至到 佢哋 立國 為止， 都 唔係 猶太人 嘅 話，事到如今  都未必 係 求其 一個 猶太人 嘅 話。係就係 佢哋 嘅 語言，但係 未必 係 佢哋 隻 話。一個人 嘅 條 脷，唔一定 係 佢 個 民族 嘅 語言。

% 但係 呢個 唔會 令到 嗰個 只識英文、俄文、德文、波蘭文 - 或者屌 - 甚至係伊拉克阿拉伯文 - 嘅猶太人 變得 冇咁 或者 唔係 猶太人。亦都 唔會 減少 話 就係 猶太人 嘅 語言 嘅呢個 關係。

% 我哋 香港人 就 唔同 喇 - 至 少喺 而家 係 咁樣嘅 一個 尷尬樣 - 因為 我哋 點樣 界定 我地自己 嘅 身份，我地 點樣 睇 我哋 自己，範範 都係 同 我哋 嘅 口語 有關。事關呢 要 講 邊個 係 香港人，就 好難 唔 率先 講 邊個邊個 係咪 講 廣東話 嘅勒——比 粵人 滬人 潮州人 更加 早 喺 香港 定居，已經 幾代 貢獻咗 汗水 去 砌 啲 經濟 同 政治 乃至 實體 基建 嘅 英格蘭人、蘇格蘭人、波斯人、錫克人，都 好 唔客氣咁 畀 呢吧 粗暴嘅 尺 請回 唔 批做 係 香港人。

% 但係 猶太人 呢 —— 佢地 嘅 語言 —— 唔係 佢 口講 嘅 話 咁簡單，而係 定義緊 佢本身 作為 一個 猶太人 嘅 身份，佢個 憲躰 嘅 語言。猶太人 嘅 語言，係 先天過 你 係咪 一個 猶太人 呢舊 野問。猶太人 嘅 語言 係 乜 並唔係 因為 你係 猶太人 而 你 講緊 啲 乜嘢 語言，所以 猶太人 嘅 語言 就係 乜；而係 猶太人  猶太人， 本身 界定左 隻 語言 係乜。
% 所以話呢，猶太人 嘅 語言 唔係 佢 條脷。呢個係佢嘅神嘅話。話 就係 佢哋 嘅 語言，一個 猶太人 吧口條脷 講 啲 乜，係，係 另外 一回事。  

% 佢哋 嘅 神 以 話 串聯晒 維繫住 佢哋，以 話 嚟 \tone{載}{}並且透過一個語料庫，將佢哋全部綁喺一個命運之下。

% 如果香港人要生存，同埋要調和佢潛在嘅廣東民族主義同沙文主義之間嘅無可挑剔嘅緊張關係，同埋佢所有嘅社區凝聚力優勢，對抗推動香港人唔單止多語言，而係傳播到各大洲嘅無法抗拒嘅力量，噉解決方法就一定係將廣東話變成一種宗教、儀式同神學嘅語言。香港人一定要逃避廣東話沙文主義嘅拉扯，而唯一可以做到嘅方法，就係將廣東話變成唔係佢民族嘅語言，而係佢嘅宗教，佢嘅信仰

% % % 猶太人之所以話自己係被選中嘅人民，係有相當基礎嘅 —— 佢哋其實唔係一個民族，至少唔符合19世紀以來對「民族」呢個詞嘅普遍定義。人類已經經歷咗幾世紀嘅歷史，令到文明已經經歷咗幾代人，但係猶太人仍然可以咁堅定同堅持噉維持自己嘅法律社群，直至今日。猶太人同所有周圍嘅民族唔同，所以只可以解釋佢哋係有特別使命嘅文明守護者。有時佢哋自己都唔完全明白自己想保護嘅係啲咩，但係佢哋知道自己有一個特別嘅世代使命，就係要保護一啲特別重要嘅嘢。佢哋稱自己為被選中嘅人民，而佢哋所繼承嘅思想係上帝委托畀佢哋嘅使命。有啲猶太人嘅傳說，例如燈籠，可能係一個側面嘅表現，反映佢哋對佢哋嘅古代使命仍然有一啲特別嘅回憶。

% % % 我越嚟越唔明點解有人會相信無神論。無神論係一個可怕嘅命題。係解放嘅，即係  係一個解放上海嘅力量。同埋你點樣可以喺情緒上處理呢個諗法？無論你用咩定義去概念化神 - 無論係透過創造者對終極好嘅定義定係終極美嘅定義，否定佢哋嘅定義，都一定會喺任何一個正常嘅男人身上引起癲癇。噉就代表你住喺地獄。

% % % 我深深憎恨 hongkibger 嘅禮貌感。佢試圖模仿日本人，但係我哋都知道，喺嗰個之下，只係醜陋、粗俗同愚蠢。呢個當然令我祈禱，我越學越多日本，我就唔會發現嗰度同日本人一樣。令人反感嘅係，香港人嘅禮貌係一種奴性嘅表達，即係只係一個自動機嘅表現。換句話講，香港人係奴隸。佢有禮貌唔係因為佢係受上帝嘅命令（理性），而係因為佢係受命令嘅人 - 佢哋係唔會好過，因為佢哋亦都唔係受上帝嘅命令。換言之，佢哋全部都係奴隸。不列顛尼亞係好唔同。嗰度嘅禮貌係進化嘅結果，係嗰度每個人都拎住武器嘅事實。所以禮貌係停火嘅產物，就好似英國嘅議會主義係每個人都拎住劍嘅產物一樣。 （有句拉丁文句子可以捕捉到呢幅圖，但係我唔記得咗）。英國人，係有禮貌嘅，因為每個人都係大師。而香港人就係有禮貌，因為個個都係奴隸。

% % % 我真心相信民族主義。因為我相信人類可以透過國家產生思想、藝術、科學、數學、美同正義嘅最大質素同多樣性。我覺得就算係所謂嘅屎忽國家（白人暗地裡覺得佢哋係屎，但係唔敢大聲講出嚟），如果有人協助佢哋解決佢哋嘅內部矛盾，等佢哋可以成為國家，噉人類就會好似萬花筒噉沐浴喺光輝同多元化之中。我特別認真噉睇伊斯蘭教嘅即將啟蒙，呢個啟蒙可能一定係以佢哋用真主去摧毀真主嘅形式出現（就好似西方呼籲佢對絕對嘅基本精神承諾，攞神同摧毀神一樣 —— 原來係殺死自己嘅破壞性炸藥）。我亦都用強烈嘅熱情去睇，中國文明嘅崩潰，誕生咗中國人。同埋我嘅神。如果噉嘅事發生，呢個世界會好好多。有啲唔開心嘅係，呢兩個項目都可能因為美國嘅存在而停滯不前。

% % % 呢個就係日本人冇現代性嘅證據。佢哋嘅古典時代從來都冇結束過。佢哋係呢個地球上唯一一個。唯一仲喺靈魂時代嘅文明。佢哋將現代性古典化，將現代性變成古典同古典現代。中國人嘗試做呢樣嘢。歐洲人殺死咗神，因此殺死咗古典主義。穆斯林令到一個文明唔會（至少仲未再）。

% % % the Chinese Malaysian is the most pathetic form of chinese in the chinese ecosystem. He was first cast away from the heartland, from the glorious vortex of the chinese civilisation, either because of his need to search for better economic opportunities, or to flee warfare. Abandoned and orphaned in barbaric uncivilised hostile lands he holds on ever more so dearly to his only spiritual assurance: his chineseness. His chineseness doth overshadow all spiritual comfort that being a Christian or a Muslim or a Buddhist can ever supply. And even though China has abandoned them, in many of their moments of direst need, they have clung on to China - with sublime and utmost faith and loyalty, for they were born chinese, and they will do everything to ensure themselves that they will die chinese. They must continually remind themselves of this because death was always just one race riot away. They are therefore the most quintessially chauvinistic unthinking fool, who still giveth thanks to the master who have forsaken them. Their loyalty and faith in China doth fettereth all their remaining reasonability and rationality and pursuit of justice. They comment and condemn that which is absolutely none of their business - because they remain chinese.  

% % % Thank god man is born to die. The Chinese Malaysian can be rest assured that they will remain chinese in death. And thankfully more still, the young hold little of their jingoism. But on the other hand, few of them know our pain as Hongkongers. Their concerns are utterly untranslatable to our own. 

% % % I implore all my chinese Malaysian friends. Don’t be chinese. Be Malaysian. If you must cling on to your chinese cultural heritage, be a Sinitic, but a Sinophile. A chinese speaker, but never a chinese.

% % % 我哋唔需要「人民」嘅支持。噉諗嘅人係閪。我哋唔需要你嘅支持。你嘅支持好平。同埋冇用。同埋自慰。我哋唔需要你嘅支持或者同情。我哋想要結果。我哋需要結果。我哋應該得到結果。如果有需要，我哋會強姦人民嘅支持。

% % % 你嘅懦弱係文明崩潰嘅原因。點解首歌會喺人民幣下面崩潰。你嘅懦弱就係我哋喺度嘅原因。我哋浸咗喺你嘅自慰汁入面。

% % % 自由唔係自由。同埋對唔住。你冇權唔買。我哋會買佢。而嗰啲唔肯畀錢嘅人就會被扣押所有財產去購買。你冇權唔自由。

% % % 我記得喺離開香港去北京之前，有個朋友嘆過，我哋有機會喺我哋做到任何嘢之前，就會用盡人民嘅支持。我哋會過期或者歡迎。佢嘆。

% % % 我同佢講：我哋一定要過咗我哋嘅歡迎。而我哋一定要耗盡我哋嘅民眾意志。我哋一定過份。我哋一定要行得太遠。唔係話我哋係或者應該對我哋用盡同情心嘅必然性感到舒服。唔係，呢個係錯誤嘅態度。我哋一定要用晒佢。渴望呢樣嘢係理性嘅事。做呢啲嘢係策略性嘅事。黃埔河上嘅戰鬥，唔會受到法國租界嘅人嘅混亂階級不滿或者哲學化。法國嘅反抗對飲酒資產階級合作主義者冇乜所謂。我哋愈早用盡佢哋嘅意志，呢班懦弱嘅人就會愈早變得無關緊要，遲啲就會對我哋嘅行為麻木。然後佢哋就會永遠停止佢哋嘅幼稚同愚蠢嘅呻吟。我哋唔需要佢哋。而且佢哋都唔想要我哋。佢哋只係想要我哋應承嘅嘢同我哋會帶嚟嘅嘢。但係佢哋唔想要血。

% % % 我哋會畀佢哋想要嘅嘢佢哋。但係我哋唔會理佢哋嘅投訴。佢哋唔緊要。

% % % 我哋一定要公眾背叛我哋。我哋想要佢。佢哋嘅支持係冇價值嘅。佢哋嘅支持係值得嘅。佢哋嘅支持冇乜用。

% % % 如果佢哋撤回支持，佢哋就唔值得畀佢哋嘅嘢。

% % % 對於嗰啲擔心我會打開一罐蟲，可以支撐所有嘢同任何嘢嘅人。你錯咗。而且你係蠢嘅。而你又唔明。我哋可以對呢件事進行分析。我可以講英文我知道要喺邊度劃線。但係條線好遠。你驚，你呻，因為我哋要行近嗰條線。你係個懦夫。同埋你驚為文明而戰。

% % % 我哋唔需要你同我哋一齊行。我哋會做到。你唔緊要。正義同救恩唔會理會好似風噉改變方向嘅小異想天開嘅公眾支持。


% % % 我哋一定係精神分裂症。我唔知上帝點樣排名真嘅、好嘅、啱嘅同靚嘅。我只知道，如果上帝將好嘅排喺右之上，噉我哋只需要關心策略。而贏得公眾支持，如果我哋要分析呢個問題，只係其中一部分。暗殺滿清官員可能對某啲人嚟講係唔受歡迎。曹汝霖屋企被燒毀可能會令人不安。就算係1966年嘅大規模轟炸同暴動。但係佢哋都唔緊要。重要嘅係好嘅係咪同佢哋一齊。

% % % 如果上帝將右邊排喺好嘅之上。然後畀咗冇嘢係啱嘅，我哋一定要喺最少嘅邪惡之下尋求好。


% % % 深入你嘅心入面。而唔係因為一啲表面文明嘅微不足道嘅聲音而有錯。睇下你嘅理性。目的嘅王國。 暴力嘅正當性就係理性嘅指揮。

% % % The history of modern Germany is one of ungodly cataclysmic irony. A people forged together by the escargot, resting and tobestanding on that cement ground made from the barbaric Germanic swamp from the likes of Kant, Leibniz, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, hammered into being with blood by Bismarck - only to be unwittingly set upon a course of earth shattering disaster that hath killed Prussia. Prussia no more is in Germany. How ironic it is now to find Germany in the state that is right now. Hath Germany committed a crime so great so that she may in atonement have us behold still that wavering yet imperishable flame that is hope? 



% % % Western democratic liberalism is the greatest idea in human history. Yet for all it's philosophical beauty, elegance, and wonder, one cannot help but despair when one sees how the primary subject on which it relies on for functionality - the human being - has so unfailing consistently successfully disappointed us the idealists - in their stupidity, arrogance, morony, illiteracy, intellectual poverty, and lack of poetic artistry. This is the bane of the democrat, the Balrog of the liberal. How can we still cling on to the dogma of the vote, when the combined force of Condorcet's jury theorem and the almost empirically proven stupidity of the human sheep, doth put you to death like a foot about to make a blotch on the ground out of an ant? 

% % % But then again this question almost reflects a certain attitude and belief about the role and purpose of democracy? What is democracy? Why democracy? Why then is stupidity so crucially benefitical to this charge against democracy? I assert that one who thinks stupidity and "irrationality" (btw people who use this term should be compelled by law to study decision theory and game theory so that they will recognise that irrationality is nonsense) is a bane of democracy, even if I were to be very generous in reading them, is that they think the primary role of the voter, is an epistemic one. We have democracy because we want a multitude of opinions. We want to find the best policy possible. We need a lot of different brains to do that. 

% % % Nothing wrong with that. And condorcet's jury theorem has proven that a society in which each voter has more than a 50% chance of getting a vote right  is significantly much more like to get the overall policy right than one man. 

% % % But is this what democracy is about? 

% % % But of course, it would be philosophically disingenuous of me to say now that the "original" purpose of democracy has never been an epistemic one. Surely there must have been epistemic formulations and justifications for democracy, and indeed people must have to different degrees conceptualised democracy to be based on such foundations. It would be very cheatish of me now here to observe the inconvenient facts and then say "oh no no no no it was never ~really~ about *that*... it's about *this* instead!"

% % % Having said that, I think it is true that the mainstream of western philosophy has never really aimed to justify democracy on epistemic grounds. Epistemic democracy does have its uses and place, probably in representative democracies (voters can be stupid which is why they don't dictate policy but can only vote for representatives and representatives should be epistemically more promising).

% % % I think, id you look through the history of the enlightenment, through the development of liberalism, you'd see that democracy has always been intricately linked to personal freedom. It is intricately linked to freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of conscience - freedoms that in some sense I would rank even more fundamental to the right to life (would anyone want to live a life where one is eternally silenced, castrated, mutilated... in speech, in thought, or in personal morality?). By the same sense, freedom from slavery is higher than the right to life. Slavery grants (trivially) satisfies the slave's right to life, but it renders all substantive meaning of that life null. It is a life not worth living. It is a torturous life. It is a life that is a prison. A life of a vegetable. Of Mitti. 0f sublime alienation. Slavery is the epitome of anti-human existence. It is the paragon of evil.
% % % Which is why Lincoln has said "if slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong."

% % % A life not in ones command, is slavery. An aspect of one's life not in one's command, is an aspect of one's life enslaved. But God has made man free - only insofar as he is free to choose which limb of him is to be chained. We are not gods (but alas god is the most unfree being of all! To be either omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent is to be most unfree! Or as Zachariah has put it, to be free from X is to be unfree from anti-X). We live in a world where the metaphysics and definitions of things have made it impossible to be free from everything  that constrains us. We are not logically allowed (God: sorry guys) to enjoy sublime positive and negative liberty. To be free in our arm, we will realise our leg is now but chained. 

% % % Our only solace, is that apparently this slavery is not conserved, and that this configuration of slavery, can modified through human will and effort. God has made man free to choose whence and where to be unfree. And that is the reason for democracy. The state, a necessity for a myriad of reasons necessitated by sheer human nature (libertarian fantasy remains only a mathematical elegance with the same level of political reality and bearing as Boolean rings) is our axe to unchain (and enchain) ourselves. How can one say then that not all be given the right to demand how it is to be programmed? What gives anybody any higher right, metaphysically speaking, over any other isomorphic being to determine the configuration of chains enslaving him? There cannot be any. Democracy is the only answer in this philosophical vacuum. 

% % % Ye who asks questions but listen not to the answer like a salmon lays eggs but waits not for them to catch is surely an intellectual waste of time. 

% % % Not all slavery are equal. To be enslaved to oneself is to definitionally be master over oneself. To be enslaved (made unfree) by metaphysics, the definitions of existence, the laws of physics, is to be enslaved by God. A homosexual can make a complaint against discrimination by his fellow human beings for their discrimination enslaves his sexual (and other aspects) aspect of his being, but he cannot reasonably make the complaint against that there are not as many homosexuals as there are heterosexuals - this is a fact of reality determined by God and not by Man. We call a Man free when he is enslaved only to himself, and to God's world. 




% % % But alas slavery need not be in the form of chains. 


% % % If the origin of Western idealism is just metaphysical idealism - belief of God - then we must answer the following questions:

% % % 2. If metaphysicality of idealism is the key, then what is that in Chinese metaphysics, particularly of the Daoists and the Neo-Confucianists, that is lacking thereby preventing it from generating a similar ideal structure with the West?

% % %  I will be very very frank. Sometimes I feel these exchange students from the so-called free world don't really know the nature of their exchange destination. Whilst they down beverages in the central concrete jungle like bees savouring  nectar, blinded by the neon phantasmagoria around them they have failed to see that they are but placed in the twilight zone - the 孟婆橋 bridging the world of the free and the world of slavery and oppression. Little they know every sip they savour from their glasses is but a gulp from the bowl of 孟婆湯. With every sip they forget more the value of freedom, and liberty, and all that their ancestors, their entire civilisation has spent lives to buy. But then again, for one to forget something one must first know that something. Perhaps they simply don't know themselves and their own history that differentiates themselves as the free peoples from the unfree. The irony. The unfree peoples knowing the freepeoples than they themselves. The unfree peoples are therefore a strange creature. A mongrel. A chimera. He knows freedom and liberty all its history, its nature, its temperament yet at the same time, he does not know it. He is forbidden from knowing it. Whilst the free man drinks on.




% % % In my greatest green adventure whilst I was flying amongst jade clouds I have come across Lady thatcher, making her last comments on hk in 1997. She said that Britain in her 150 year rule of hk has demonstrated one fact. Chinese people in Hong Kong, are immensely talented. Hong Kong has no natural resources. Meanwhile, the Chinese people in china, are also immensely talented. They do have natural resources. Yet the former was most prosperous while the latter was bathed in abject poverty. Now why is that? It is because the people of hk were able to express their talent in a system that guaranteed freedom, that guaranteed their rights under the rule of law, that guaranteed reasonable legislation.

% % % 難道這就是尼采說的人上人須有人上人的道德？



% % % This popular disease we see in the sinosphere known, this social norm of setting respect as a fundamental playing field of all social interactions, should be dragged to court in the most undignified manner and subsequently given the most kangarooish of trials and violently rebuked and viciously and murderously destroyed. The human being deserves no respect. The metaphysics of morality only grant man rights and duties, and none of its myriad of laws grant humanity any right to respect. This fetishisation of respect, so deeply rooted in the Chinese mind, is nothing more than the most vile manifestations of the will to power at work. The moron, with no ability to reason, diverts the focus of the discussion from the issue to the tone of the discussion. He claims he has been wronged by your tone - your disrespect towards him. There's a very good Cantonese word for this behaviour. 發爛咋。one must never succumb to these blackmails. One should pursue on, and be so unreservedly violent that one shouldnt leave the scene without this morons brains flowing out of his arse. This is a man who poisons the well and kills all intellectualism in the village. This is a man who speaks only to accumulate power. This is a man who confuses the metaphysical and the purely constructed. This is a man, who takes the constructed value of respect, which we need for our day to day functionalities of society, and abuses for his most selfish and vile ends. 

% % % One must not feed monsters of this kind lest they grow stronger and stronger. And one must be brave in chopping off its many heads wherever one might find them. and in this regard, I must confess I cannot be more disappointed at myself for submitting to those 教畜 at the so called College of Ying Wa. So vile and so bereft of humanity. These disciplinarians, who mutter "spare the rod spoil the child" ere every time they lash out for nothing but their own sexual release, for that intoxicating pocket of endorphins to burst, for that scintillating taste of power - they should have been utterly utterly humiliated. These animals, are why we the peoples of huasia have seen no great civilisation. We castrate our young  to make sausages for the elders. I can see your ugly toad face licking that last drop of blood-gravy, SK and 龐狗。and whilst they savour their meals, Geniuses like KJ wong - simply bleed to death. 辱於奴隸人之手，駢死於槽櫪之間，不以千里稱也. 

% % % But this cult of respect extends beyond the education factory. You must learn to see it everywhere. In the bureaucracy of our institutions, in our families, amongst our friends. This demand of undeserved respect is but a shield for the unworthy, the stupid, the vile, and those who will power but have no right to do so. Respect gives them the room to spew verbal  diarrhea and consequently weaken our society. Be brave. Expose their pink naked crippled truths behind that shield. Give no ounce of respect. Be so thorough and so violent and merciless that they leave unable to ever speak again without intellectual distillation. 

% % % 人在生時，必須萬般自大，盡求傲氣四煞，萬萬不可在世時 謙虛。因為當萬物歸土，化為泡影時，人就會永世沉寂，永遠謙虛。



% % % I have long wondered if all users of the sinoglyphs have brains made of shit. You would have thought that the Taiwanese in their thirty years of democratic intellectual training to have evolved. Well yes they have but only so much. The Taiwanese stands only ten percent more politically intellectual than the mainlander. Or rather, instead of stupidity their population is mostly immature and childish. The people commenting on Keith Fong’s post are so naive it begs one to not believe they’re actually members of Taiwan. 沒有義務喎，so what would you have us do? Cry and beg for taiwan to help as we cry and beg China to not fuck us over? And ffs how dare you ask where we were when taiwan was under martial law? It’s such an idiotic question! Hongkongers as a thing didn’t exist at least until the 70s and we were not fucking democratically empowered ffs. And all this masturbatory nonsense from the Taiwanese about already having an army and congress - what do you want? You can’t solicit recognition of sovereignty from proper nations so you will symbolically squeeze juice out of a nationless people? And please, why is ur nation shit? Why have you been isolated? Why have you squandered all your natural advantages well? Why do you have fucking generals defecting? You want dignity but you don’t carry any in your nation! Do you know why? Because your entire nation is fucking 小確幸 and you spend all your time fucking around with gay marriage while China has been not so secretly butt raping you. (Employ all your analyticality to find fault in the last statement. The English brain doesn’t know anything else. The English leftist mind pounces on stuff like this like goldsmith university anti-imperialist society members pounced on the anti zhina slurs.)
