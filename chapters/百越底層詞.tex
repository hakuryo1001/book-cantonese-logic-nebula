It is generally accepted that Cantonese is a Sinitic language with heavy influences from ancient Baiyue languages in terms of phonology, grammatical structure and vocabulary. Even though our Baak-jyut/Baiyue ancestors were colonised and eventually Sinicised, they had nevertheless left in our language an obvious Baiyue substratum, including substrate words which are mostly of Tai-Kradai, Austroasiatic and Hmong-Mien origins. These substrate words, though relatively small in number compared to Sinitic words, are among the commonest and most frequently used words in daily Cantonese conversations.

Here is a list of substrate words I can think of, with possible cognates inside the brackets.

Disclaimer: I am neither a scholar nor an expert in relevant fields. I've made this list purely based on my memories, a few essays of “dialect” (🙄) studies in Chinese and wiktionary. Regarding some words I've listed below, whether they are substrate words or not is still unconfirmed or disputed.

> The fruit is called 碌柚 in Canton/Hong Kong Cantonese, but 孤㯷 is actually the common name for pomelo in my dialect. "Buk" is the original Tai-Kradai word for pomelo. Many other Cantonese dialects, such as Sanwui dialect or Taishanese also call it 布碌/波碌/etc. meaning "little pomelo" (buk/bu/bo=pomelo, luk=child/classifier for fruit)

> People in Canton call common people “lau” or “leu”, both derogatory. -- _Guangdong Xinyu_, 1678

碌 luk1 as in 碌柚: child [Thai ลูก (luuk)]  
细路仔 sai3 lou6 zai2: child, boy [路 is the same word with 碌 above. 路仔 is obviously a cognate with Thai ลูกชาย (luukchaai) or Zhuang "lwgsai" meaning "son"]
